Convenient utilities for adding `OpenTracing <http://opentracing.io>`_ support in your python projects.

Features
========

``opentracing-utils`` should provide and aims at the following:

* No extrenal dependencies, only `opentracing-python <https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python>`_.
* No threadlocals. Either pass spans explicitly or fallback to callstack frames inspection!
* Context agnostic, so no external **context implementation** dependency (no Tornado, Flask, Django etc ...).
* Try to be less verbose - just add the ``@trace`` decorator.
* Could be more verbose when needed, without complexity - just accept ``**kwargs`` and get the span passed to your traced functions via ``@trace(pass_span=True)``.
* Support asyncio/async-await coroutines. (drop support for py2.7)
* Support **gevent**.
* Ability to add OpenTracing support to external libs/frameworks/clients:

    * Flask (via ``trace_flask()``)
    * Requests (via ``trace_requests()``)
    * TODO ...

Install
=======

Using pip (not released yet to PyPi)

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U -e git+ssh://git@github.com/zalando-zmon/opentracing-utils.git#egg=opentracing_utils


or by cloning the repo

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install


Usage
=====

init_opentracing_tracer
-----------------------

The first step needed in OpenTracing instrumentation is to initialize a tracer. Each vendor defines how the tracer can be initialized. Currently the following tracers are supported:

* `BasicTracer <https://github.com/opentracing/basictracer-python>`_
* `Instana <https://github.com/instana/python-sensor>`_
* `Jaeger <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-python/>`_
* `LightStep <https://github.com/lightstep/lightstep-tracer-python>`_

BasicTracer
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the basic noop tracer. It could be initialized with a recorder (e.g. `Memory Recorder <https://github.com/opentracing/basictracer-python/blob/master/basictracer/recorder.py#L21>`_), which can be useful in debugging and playing around with OpenTracing concepts.

.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from opentracing_utils import OPENTRACING_BASIC, init_opentracing_tracer

    # Initialize upon application start
    init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_BASIC)

    # It is possible to pass custom recorder
    # init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_BASIC, recorder=custom_recorder)

    # Now use the opentracing.tracer
    root_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='root_span')

Instana
^^^^^^^

Config Vars
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following config variables can be used in initialization if set as env variables

OPENTRACING_INSTANA_SERVICE
  The service name.

.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from opentracing_utils import OPENTRACING_INSTANA, init_opentracing_tracer

    # Initialize upon application start
    init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_INSTANA)

    # It is possible to pass args
    # init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_INSTANA, service='python-server')

    # Now use the opentracing.tracer
    root_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='root_span')

Jaeger
^^^^^^

Config Vars
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following config variables can be used in initialization if set as env variables

OPENTRACING_JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME
  The service name.

.. note::

    Jaeger configuration should be passed by the instrumentated code. Default is ``{}``.


.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from opentracing_utils import OPENTRACING_JAEGER, init_opentracing_tracer

    # Initialize upon application start
    init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_JAEGER)

    # It is possible to pass args
    # init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_JAEGER, service_name='python-server', config=custom_config_with_sampling)

    # Now use the opentracing.tracer
    root_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='root_span')


LightStep
^^^^^^^^^

Config Vars
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following config variables can be used in initialization if set as env variables

OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP_COMPONENT_NAME
  The component name.

OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP_ACCESS_TOKEN
  The LightStep collector access token.

OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP_COLLECTOR_HOST
  The LightStep collector host. Default: ``collector.lightstep.com``.

OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP_COLLECTOR_PORT
  The LightStep collector port (``int``). Default: ``443``.

OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP_VERBOSITY
  The verbosity of the tracer (``int``). Default: ``0``.

.. code-block:: python

    import opentracing
    from opentracing_utils import OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP, init_opentracing_tracer

    # Initialize upon application start
    init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP)

    # It is possible to pass args
    # init_opentracing_tracer(OPENTRACING_LIGHTSTEP, component_name='python-server', access_token='123', collector_host='production-collector.com')

    # Now use the opentracing.tracer
    root_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='root_span')


@trace decorator
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from opentracing_utils import trace, extract_span_from_kwargs

    # decorate all your functions that require tracing

    # Normal traced function
    @trace()
    def trace_me():
        pass


    # Traced function with access to created span in ``kwargs``
    @trace(operation_name='user.operation', pass_span=True)
    def user_operation(user, op, **kwargs):
        current_span = extract_span_from_kwargs(**kwargs)

        current_span.set_tag('user.id', user.id)

        # Then do stuff ...

        # trace_me will have ``current_span`` as its parent.
        trace_me()

    # Traced function using ``follows_from`` instead of ``child_of`` reference.
    @trace(use_follows_from=True)
    def trace_me_later():
        pass


    # Start a fresh trace - any parent spans will be ignored
    @trace(operation_name='epoch', ignore_parent_span=True)
    def start_fresh():

        user = {'id': 1}

        # trace decorator will handle trace heirarchy
        user_operation(user, 'create')

        # trace_me will have ``epoch`` span as its parent.
        trace_me()

Skip Spans
^^^^^^^^^^

In certain cases you might need to skip certain spans while using the ``@trace`` decorator.

.. code-block:: python

    def skip_this_span(arg1, arg2, **kwargs):
        if arg1 == 'special':
            # span should be skipped
            return True

        return False


    @trace(skip_span=skip_this_span)
    def traced(arg1, arg2):
        pass


    top_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='top_trace')
    with top_span:
        # this call will be traced and have a span!
        traced('open', 'tracing')

        # this call won't be traced and no span to be added!
        traced('special', 'tracing')


Broken traces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you plan to break nested traces, then it is recommended to pass the span to traced functions

.. code-block:: python

    top_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='top_trace')
    with top_span:

        # This one gets ``top_span`` as parent span
        call_traced()

        # Here, we break the trace, since we create a new span with no parents
        broken_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='broken_trace')
        with broken_span:
            # This one gets ``broken_span`` as parent span (not consistent in 2.7 and 3.5)
            call_traced()

            # pass span as safer/guaranteed trace here
            call_traced(span=broken_span)

        # ISSUE: Due to stack call inspection, next call will get ``broken_span`` instead of ``top_span``, which is wrong!!
        call_traced()

        # To get the ``top_span`` as parent span, then pass it to the traced call
        call_traced(span=top_span)


Multiple traces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you plan to use multiple traces then it is better to always pass the span as it is safer/guaranteed.

.. code-block:: python

    first_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='first_trace')
    with first_span:

        # This one gets ``first_span`` as parent span
        call_traced()

    second_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='second_trace')
    with second_span:

        # ISSUE: This one **could** get ``first_span`` as parent span (not consistent among Python versions)
        call_traced()

        # It is better to pass ``second_span`` explicitly
        call_traced(span=second_span)


Generators (yield)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using generators could get tricky and leads to invalid parent span inspection. It is recommended to pass the span explicitly.

.. code-block:: python

    @trace(pass_span=True)
    def gen(**kwargs):
        s = extract_span_from_kwargs(**kwargs)  # noqa

        # Extract and pass span to ``f2()`` otherwise it could get ``f1()`` as parent span instead of ``gen()``
        f2(span=s)

        for i in range(10):
            yield i

    @trace()
    def f2():
        pass

    @trace()
    def f1():
        list(gen())

    first_span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='first_trace')
    with first_span:
        f1()


External libraries and clients
------------------------------

Flask
^^^^^

For tracing `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ applications. This utility function adds a middleware that handles all incoming requests to the Flask application.

.. code-block:: python

    from opentracing_utils import trace_flask, extract_span_from_flask_request
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    trace_flask(app)

    # You can add default_tags or optionally treat 4xx responses as not an error (i.e no error tag in span)
    # trace_flask(app, default_tags={'always-there': True}, error_on_4xx=False)

    # Extract current span from request context
    def internal_function():
        current_span = extract_span_from_flask_request()

        current_span.set_tag('internal', True)


Requests
^^^^^^^^

For tracing `requests <https://github.com/requests/requests>`_ client library for all outgoing requests.

.. code-block:: python

    # trace_requests should be called as early as possible, before importing requests
    from opentracing_utils import trace_requests
    trace_requests()  # noqa

    # In case you want to include default span tags to be sent with every outgoing request.
    # trace_requests(default_tags={'account_id': '123'}, set_error_tag=False)

    # In case you want to keep the URL query args (masked by default in order to avoid leaking auth tokens etc...)
    # trace_requests(mask_url_query=False)

    # You can also mask URL path parameters (e.g. http://hostname/1 will be http://hostname/??/)
    # trace_requests(mask_url_path=True)

    # The library patches the requests library send functionality. This causes
    # all requests to propagate the span id's in the headers. Sometimes this is
    # undesireable so it's also possible to avoid tracing specific URL's or
    # endpoints. trace_requests accepts a list of regex patterns and matches the
    # request.url against these patterns, ignoring traces if any pattern matches.
    # trace_requests(ignore_patterns=[r".*hostname/endpoint"]

    import requests

    def main():

        span = opentracing.tracer.start_span(operation_name='main')
        with span:
            # Following call will be traced as a ``child span`` and propagated via HTTP headers.
            requests.get('https://example.org')
